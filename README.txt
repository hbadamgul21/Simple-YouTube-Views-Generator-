**********Simple YouTube views generator************


BACKSTORY:

I wanted to try and make a simple Youtube view generator, by no means is this suppose to bypass the YouTube algorithm; however, it seems to work just fine so far. 

Just place your URL link, and give the amount of times you want it to run. What I noticed is that if I run it for 50 views, I would pretty much get half of those views.

I choose iexplorer, that way I can work on another browser while having this program run in the background. So far, it has not hinder my work. 

Finally, like I said it was a simple thing I wanted to make on the spot. Did not expect it to work, but it works...slowly. Haha

Anyways, I would do this every other day and keep it on 50 views, after it ended I would check my video on YouTube 1-2 hours later to see the applied views. 

NOTE: You could use this with a VPN or perhaps try and use Tor instead of iexplorer. 

Side Note: This works on windows only. -----> <windows.h>

Usage:

Paste your video url link in:  "URL link("Paste Your Link Here", 50);" in the main(). Change the 50 to your desired views, I would keep it 50 or below. 

Then on the command line: g++ openURL.cpp -o Program 

Run the Program: Program.exe
